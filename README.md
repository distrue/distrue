ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm backend developer, now working in [Channel Corporation](https://channel.io) as backend engineer.<br/>
I mainly have developed web services using `typescript`, `java`, and `golang`.<br/>
I'm now interested in designing bullet-proof server architecture for various services.<br/>
I love to build simple service, library and contribute to developer ecosystem.
